                <p>Situated near the picturesque Kinsky Garden in the center of Prague, Gabriel Loci is a Neo-Romanesque complex built as a convent in the late 19th century. It includes intriguing spaces like The Garden of Eden – a spacious hall with a spectacular glass ceiling, or the Church of the Annunciation with beautiful paintings. The complex features artistic decoration in the style of the Beuron Art School, founded by a confederation of Benedictine monks in Germany.</p>

                <h4>Car parking</h4>
                <p>You can park along the street Švedská in the purple zone. Parallel to Holečkova there is Grafická Street with another purple zone. Make sure to pay the parking fee using the machine or use the MPLA app (Google, Apple). Read about parking zones in Prague.</p>
