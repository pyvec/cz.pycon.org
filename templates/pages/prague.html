                    Prague is the capital of the Czech Republic. The country’s official names are Czech Republic (Česká republika) and Czechia (Česko). A country named Czechoslovakia doesn’t exist anymore—it split up 30 years ago.
                </p>
                <p>Prague is known as the city of a hundred spires and it is one of the most visited cities in Europe. Sitting on the Vltava River, the beautiful historic centre is a UNESCO world heritage site. There’s a <strong>lot</strong> to see, do and enjoy, in addition to the conference!</p>

            <div class="col-md">
                <h3>Language</h3>
                <p>We speak Czech and generally understand Slovak perfectly. English should be well understood, especially among younger people. German or a Slavic language like Polish can work as a fallback.</p>

                <h3>Weather</h3>
                <p>Prague weather in September is mild with an average temperature of 21°C. At night, the weather cools to 11°C, which is quite cold so don’t forget to take a jacket out with you in the evening. You’ll have eight hours of sunshine per day.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md">
                <h3>Money</h3>
                <p>We pay with CZK (“koruna”, also abbreviated Kč). The exchange rate is approximately 1 EUR = 24.5 CZK. Cards (mostly Visa and Mastercard) are accepted in chain stores, larger places, coffee places or pubs, but less often in smaller shops.</p>
                <p>It’s useful to carry some cash around. ATMs are omnipresent, but avoid Euronet because of their high fees. All ATMs operated by banks are ok. Money exchange booths sometimes offer smaller fees and better deals than banks, but some are tourist traps. Just make sure you’re getting at least 24 CZK for 1 EUR. Czechia also has a law to protect you from scam exchange offices: you have 3 hours to revert the transaction and get your money back up to 1000 EUR. For this you need keep the bill.</p>

                <h2>Travelling around Prague</h2>
                <p>Prague has an excellent <a href="https://idos.idnes.cz/en/praha/spojeni/?lang=e">system of public transport</a>, which includes three lines of metro trains, trams, buses and ferries. If you’re into biking, check local bikesharing <a href="https://www.rekola.cz/en/">Rekola</a> or <a href="https://www.nextbikeczech.com/en/">nextbike</a>. While <a href="https://www.uber.com/cz/en/">Uber</a> is available in Prague, the <a href="https://www.liftago.com/">Liftago</a> app provides a very similar experience.</p>
                <p>With a Czech SIM card, you can use SMS tickets, otherwise you need to buy paper ones in yellow ticket machines. Zone P includes everything you need, even the airport area.</p>

                <p>At night, there is a different, limited system of public transport and metro is completely out of order. The last train leaves just after midnight. Trams and buses operate through the whole night. Depending on your route, it still might be okay to take public transport, but calling Uber or Liftago is usually less tiring.</p>

                <h2>Accommodation in Prague</h2>

                <p>Please note that there isn’t a single place where all attendees will be accommodated.

If you want to be close to the main venue, you can use Google Maps to check which accommodations are near the closest public stop — Holečkova.</p>

                <h2>Safety</h2>
                <p>Prague is very safe comparing to other capital cities, however petty theft is a problem, especially in major tourist areas. Pickpocketing is common at busy places and on public transport.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md">
                <h2>Sockets</h2>
                <p>The most common type of electrical outlet in the Czech Republic, where Prague is located, is the <a href="https://www.worldstandards.eu/electricity/plugs-and-sockets/e/">Type E plug</a> (often referred to as the  “French” plug). This plug has two round pins and a contact for the grounding. The standard voltage in the Czech Republic is 230V, and the frequency is 50 Hz.</p>
